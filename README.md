This contains the OS bindings for the Mirage operating system, primarily
through an `OS` OCaml module. The following backends are available:

* Unix: maps POSIX resources and executes Mirage apps as normal binaries.

* Xen: a microkernel backend that can run against Xen3+

* kFreeBSD: runs Mirage apps inside the FreeBSD kernel
